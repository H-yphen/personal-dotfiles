This is a list of packages that are very useful to have on board:

keepassxc -- a password database with password generation (diceware) abilities
liquidprompt -- better bash prompt
python3-pygments -- syntax highlighter that works like cat (pygmentize -g <file>)
silversearcher-ag -- aka the silver searcher, much faster and friendlier than find
command-not-found -- command suggestions
shellcheck -- static shellscript linter
figlet/toilet -- banners in terminal
nethogs -- a small net top that associates traffic by process rather than port
ocl-icd -- OpenCL video drivers for intel integrated graphics, helps a lot next to mesa. Your current hardware supports OpenCL not GL
dos2unix -- a simple tool that converts the line ending characters in text files
	Windows text files end in LF+CR aka \n\r
	UNIX files only end with LF
	hence this tool.

[pip]
exrex -- a great tool that generates wordlists from regex
diceware -- highly customizable diceware password generator
lolcat -- RAINBOWS!
magic-wormhole -- lan file exchange tool

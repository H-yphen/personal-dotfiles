This is a list of packages that are very useful to have on board:

liquidprompt -- better bash prompt
python3-pygments -- syntax highlighter that works like cat (pygmentize -g <file>)
silversearcher-ag -- aka the silver searcher, much faster and friendlier than find
command-not-found -- command suggestions
nethogs -- a small net top that associates traffic by process rather than port

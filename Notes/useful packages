This is a list of packages that are very useful to have on board:

liquidprompt -- better bash prompt
python3-pygments -- syntax highlighter that works like cat (pygmentize -g <file>)

silversearcher-ag -- aka the silver searcher, much faster and friendlier than find

command-not-found -- command suggestions

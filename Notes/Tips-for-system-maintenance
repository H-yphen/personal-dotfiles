- If you edit a config file and you want to keep track of all the config files you edited, you can leave a special string in a comment to grep on later.
  example: I edit /etc/fstab so I leave #EDITED on the file (preferably the same place I edited) and now I can do a system-wide grep of all the files that contain #EDITED to see the things I've done
  
- Building maintenance is important. It is advised to keep all your source code together in a folder so that you can access any program's makefile and find out where it spat its files so that you can keep your system clean and maintainable
  note: always tee your make/configure outputs into a log file
  note: foo.h header files are usually in foo-dev* packages
  note: check a package's cflags, ldflags, and prefix options. prefixing is especially useful for my third-to-mention point
  note: it is generally cleaner to turn your source code into a package before installing, as it makes managing things cleaner and more consistent. Plus, depends and versioning.

- GNU stow is a great, GREAT, build manager that keeps track of all the files spat by your make as long as your prefix is the stow base directory. It uses soft links to achieve this and it works amazingly. PERFECT for multi-versioning and keeping a clean filesystem
